The Saint Paul Garden Club (SPGC) was founded in 1927 by 30 women, and was accepted into the Garden Club
of America in 1933. Throughout its history, the SPGC has dedicated itself to urban beautification, conservation
and land stewardship, and to providing educational programs in the area of horticulture and conservation.

<p>
The women of the SPGC have devoted time and talent to beautifying their city. From 1927 to the present they
have been instrumental in keeping Rice Park looking beautiful, by planting tulips, planting and maintaining the
hosta gardens and planters, and most recently, developing a perennial garden on the south side of the park. A
close association with the Arboretum resulted in the Garden Club purchasing 97 acres for the Arboretum in the
1960s and establishing the azalea and rhododendron experimental gardens. An equally close relationship with
Swede Hollow resulted in the establishment of Swede Hollow Park for which we received the Garden Club of
America’s Founder’s Fund Award in 1977. GCA awarded SPGC $7,000 as the Founders Fund runner-up for our
work restoring the Soddy at Gibbs Farm. In 2003, the SPGC was awarded a STAR Grant by the City of St. Paul to
fund “Blooming St. Paul,” a program still in existence today.

Through its allocation process the SPGC gives generously to organizations that seek funding for conservation and
horticultural projects. Since 1981 when the first fund raiser, the Tea Dance, was held, the SPGC has contributed
over $350,000 to various organizations including the Children’s Hospital Green Plant Therapy Program, Dodge
Nature Center, the Landscape Plant Development Center, the Arboretum, the Minnesota Horticultural Society,
Rice Park and Swede Hollow.
</p>

<p>
Every two to three years the SPGC sponsors a Flower Show for its members and for the public at large. The
two most recent were entitled “Floral Discovery” and “Autumn Joy” and were held at the Marjorie McNeely
Conservatory at Como Park. Our creative and talented members often receive St. Paul Garden Club and Garden
Club of America awards.
</p>

<p>
The 97 members of the SPGC enjoy monthly meetings at which noted speakers give educational talks in the area
of horticulture, conservation, flower arranging and photography. At the luncheons that follow, members share
their love of gardening with one another.
</p>

<p>
The SPGC is privileged to be a member of the Garden Club of America and looks forward to co-sponsoring the
2016 annual meeting with the Minnetonka Garden Club.
